# spec-intake

## What to Extract

From the spec, identify:
1. **Objective** — one sentence: what changes and why
2. **Acceptance criteria** — the testable conditions from the spec's acceptance criteria section
3. **Files in scope** — files explicitly named or clearly implied
4. **Dependencies** — other features or beads this work depends on
5. **Out of scope** — what the spec explicitly defers

## Ambiguity

If the spec is ambiguous on a critical implementation detail, note it in the epic description. Do not invent decisions — leave them for the developer bead.

## Do Not Over-Specify

Acceptance criteria in child beads should be verifiable, not prescriptive about implementation. "The planner output schema rejects invalid agent_type values" is good. "The `build_planner_prompt` function adds an enum field to the JSON schema at line 42" is too specific.

Criteria that are satisfied only by running the test suite or tests ("tests pass", "suite is green", "pytest ... passes") go on the shared tester bead only. Never put them on developer, documentation or review beads; the merge gate runs the full suite anyway.

## Requirements Section

If the spec contains a `## Requirements` section, apply the following rule when populating the shared tester bead's acceptance criteria:

- For every `### ADDED:` and `### MODIFIED:` entry, copy every scenario into the shared tester bead's acceptance criteria without dropping any content. Include the full scenario: the `#### Scenario: <name>` heading, every `- **WHEN**` line, every `- **THEN**` line, and any `- **AND**` lines, in the criterion form below.
- Write each scenario as exactly one criterion, in this exact form (note the em dash, U+2014, surrounded by single spaces):

  `Scenario: <capability> / <requirement name> / <scenario name> — <WHEN/THEN text>`

  `<capability>` is the capability the requirement belongs to, `<requirement name>` is the `### ADDED:`/`### MODIFIED:` name, `<scenario name>` is the `#### Scenario:` name, and `<WHEN/THEN text>` is the scenario's WHEN, THEN and AND lines joined into one line. Do not reword, reorder or merge scenarios; the prefix is what lets later accounting match a criterion back to its scenario.
- Capability, requirement and scenario names must not contain ` — `, ` -- ` or ` - ` (space-delimited dashes), because those sequences are reserved as delimiters. If a name contains one, rename it in the spec rather than escaping it in the criterion.
- `### REMOVED:` entries carry no scenarios and are ignored at planning time.
- Scenarios from the Requirements section **supplement** — they do not replace — any explicit acceptance criteria the spec already provides for the tester bead.

Note (not implemented): `takt spec validate` could enforce the delimiter rule by rejecting capability, requirement or scenario names containing ` — `, ` -- ` or ` - `.
