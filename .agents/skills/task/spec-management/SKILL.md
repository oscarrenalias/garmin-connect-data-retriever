# spec-management

`takt spec` is the canonical tool for managing spec files. Always use it for spec lifecycle operations; do not use `mv`, manual frontmatter edits, or direct file manipulation.

## Getting Started

Before using any spec commands, make sure the project has a specs directory.

### Initialise specs/ if absent

Check whether the project already has a specs directory:

```bash
test -d specs && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
```

If missing, initialise it before doing anything else:

```bash
uv run takt spec init
```

This creates `specs/`, `specs/drafts/`, `specs/planned/`, and `specs/done/`. Only needs to be done once per project.

> **Note:** If `specs/` already exists but is missing its lifecycle subdirectories, the `create` subcommand will create them automatically. `spec init` is only required to create the top-level `specs/` directory itself.

"drafts", "planned", and "done" are the default lifecycle stages, but custom status values are supported. The skill enforces that a spec file lives in the folder matching its `status` frontmatter field, so if you use custom status values, the skill script will enforce the correct folder structure automatically.

## Invocation

Run from the project root (where `specs/` lives):

```bash
uv run takt spec <subcommand> [args]
```

`takt spec` ships with takt; there is nothing to locate or install separately.

## Subcommands

### `create <title>` — Create a new spec

Creates a new spec file in `specs/drafts/` with a generated ID and a standard template.

```bash
uv run takt spec create "My Feature Title"
```

Output: path to the created file and its generated ID (e.g. `spec-a3f19c2b`).

The filename is derived from the title as a slug (lowercase, hyphens, `.md` extension).

If `specs/` exists but the lifecycle subdirectories (`drafts/`, `planned/`, `done/`) are absent, `create` creates them automatically. Running `spec init` beforehand is not required when `specs/` already exists.

---

### `list` — List all specs

Lists specs across all lifecycle folders with their ID, status, priority, complexity, and name.

```bash
uv run takt spec list
uv run takt spec list --status draft
uv run takt spec list --status planned
uv run takt spec list --tag backend
uv run takt spec list --priority high
```

Filters can be combined. Legacy specs (no frontmatter) are shown with status `legacy`.

---

### `show <spec>` — Show spec details

Prints the frontmatter and first 20 lines of body for a spec. Use `--full` to print the entire body. Use `--body-only` to print the body without frontmatter — always use this when passing a spec to the `spec-reviewer` agent or any other agent that should not see frontmatter fields.

```bash
uv run takt spec show spec-a3f19c2b
uv run takt spec show my-feature
uv run takt spec show --full spec-a3f19c2b
uv run takt spec show --body-only spec-a3f19c2b
```

See [ID and filename resolution](#id-and-filename-resolution) for how `<spec>` is matched.

---

### `set status <value> <spec>` — Transition lifecycle status

Updates the `status` field in frontmatter **and moves the file** to the matching lifecycle folder. This is the only supported way to change a spec's lifecycle stage.

```bash
uv run takt spec set status planned spec-a3f19c2b
uv run takt spec set status done    spec-a3f19c2b
uv run takt spec set status draft   spec-a3f19c2b
```

Valid values: `draft`, `planned`, `done`.

| Status | Folder |
|--------|--------|
| `draft` | `specs/drafts/` |
| `planned` | `specs/planned/` |
| `done` | `specs/done/` |

Output: new path of the file after the move.

> **Do not use `mv`** to move spec files between folders. `set status` keeps the frontmatter and filesystem location in sync atomically.

**Merge-on-done:** When transitioning to `done` from a non-`done` status, `set status done` also validates and applies the spec's `## Requirements` section to the capability files under `specs/current/`. If validation fails, the command exits 1, leaves the spec in its original folder, and writes nothing to `specs/current/`. On success, it prints one `merged: <OP> <capability> / <requirement name>` line per delta applied.

Custom status values are supported. The skill will create the necessary folders as needed and enforce that the `status` field matches the folder name.

---

### `set feature-root <bead-id> <spec>` — Link to a feature root bead

Sets the `feature_root_id` frontmatter field.

```bash
uv run takt spec set feature-root B-a7bc3f91 spec-a3f19c2b
```

---

### `set tags <tag1,tag2,...> <spec>` — Replace tags

Replaces the `tags` list in frontmatter. Provide tags as a comma-separated string.

```bash
uv run takt spec set tags "backend,auth" spec-a3f19c2b
```

---

### `set priority <value> <spec>` — Set priority

Sets the `priority` field. Valid values: `high`, `medium`, `low`.

```bash
uv run takt spec set priority high spec-a3f19c2b
```

---

### `set description <text> <spec>` — Set description

Sets the `description` frontmatter field to a single-line text value.

```bash
uv run takt spec set description "Adds OAuth login support" spec-a3f19c2b
```

---

### `migrate <spec>` — Add frontmatter to a legacy spec

Adds a standard frontmatter block to a spec file that has none. Infers the name from the first `# Heading` or the filename, generates a new ID, and infers the status from the file's current folder.

```bash
uv run takt spec migrate old-spec-filename
```

Fails if the spec already has frontmatter.

---

### `search <query>` — Search specs

Hybrid (semantic + keyword) search over the section-level index of all specs. Returns ranked documents with ID, status, title, section and snippet. Use it instead of grepping `specs/` or searching the memory `specs` namespace.

```bash
uv run takt spec search "<query>" [--status S]... [--tag T]... [--limit N] [--chunks] [--json] [--plain]
uv run takt spec search "merge=ours" --status planned --limit 5
```

- `--status S` — repeatable; OR across values.
- `--tag T` — repeatable; AND across values.
- `--limit N` — maximum results (default 10).
- `--chunks` — return individual matching sections instead of the best section per spec.
- `--json` — array of `{id, type, status, title, path, section, snippet, score}`.
- `--plain` — tab-separated `id\tstatus\tsection\tscore\ttitle`, no snippet.

No hits prints `No matches.` (exit 0). Search first syncs the index with the files, so it reflects hand edits and moves. From a feature worktree it reads the main checkout's index and files. Exits 1 if there is no `.takt/` project.

### `reindex` — Rebuild the spec index

```bash
uv run takt spec reindex           # rebuild from scratch; prints "indexed <n> spec documents (<m> chunks)"
uv run takt spec reindex --check   # dry run; prints "would add <a>, update <u>, remove <r> (<k> unchanged)"
```

Normally unnecessary (search reconciles automatically); use it after bulk file changes or to inspect drift with `--check`.

### `remove <spec>` — Delete a spec file

Permanently deletes the spec file. Behaviour depends on status:

- **draft** specs are deleted immediately with no confirmation.
- **planned** or **done** specs prompt for confirmation (`[y/N]`) to prevent accidental deletion.

```bash
uv run takt spec remove spec-a3f19c2b
uv run takt spec remove my-feature
```

Use `--force` to skip the confirmation prompt (useful in automated or non-interactive contexts):

```bash
uv run takt spec remove --force spec-a3f19c2b
```

> **Note for agents:** always use `--force` when deleting specs non-interactively, otherwise the confirmation prompt will block execution.

---

### `validate <spec>` — Validate the Requirements section

Checks the `## Requirements` section for structural correctness and consistency with `specs/current/`.

```bash
uv run takt spec validate spec-a3f19c2b
uv run takt spec validate my-feature
uv run takt spec validate path/to/spec.md   # also accepts a file path
```

Exit codes:
- **0** — all entries are valid (or no Requirements section is present); prints `OK: <path> (<n> requirement deltas)` or `OK: <path> (no Requirements section)`
- **1** — one or more structural or consistency errors; each printed to stderr as `error: <path>: <heading>: <message>`

`validate` reads files only; it never creates or modifies anything.

---

## ID and Filename Resolution

Every subcommand that takes a `<spec>` argument resolves it as follows:

1. **Exact ID match** — if the query equals the `id` field (e.g. `spec-a3f19c2b`) in any spec's frontmatter, that spec is returned immediately.
2. **Partial filename match** — if the query is a substring of a spec's filename stem (case-insensitive), the matching files are collected.
   - Exactly one match → that spec is used.
   - Zero matches → `error: no spec matching "<query>"` (exit 1).
   - Multiple matches → `error: "<query>" matches multiple specs: <id-list>` (exit 1). Use a more specific query or the full ID.

Exact ID match always takes priority over filename matching.

## Frontmatter Schema

New specs are created with this template:

```yaml
---
name: <title>
id: spec-<8-hex-chars>
description:
dependencies:
priority:
complexity:
status: draft
tags: []
scope:
  in:
  out:
feature_root_id:
---
```

Edit the body freely; `takt spec` preserves body content when updating frontmatter fields.

---

## Folder Structure and Lifecycle

```
specs/
  drafts/     # Spec written, not yet planned (no beads created)
  planned/    # Planner has run and beads are persisted; implementation in progress
  done/       # All beads merged to main; feature is live
  current/    # Reserved — per-capability living specs, updated by set status done
```

**Rule:** A spec lives in exactly one folder. Move it forward only when the transition condition is met.

`specs/current/` is reserved. `takt spec list`, `show`, and `set` never treat files under it as specs. `set status current` exits 1 with `error: "current" is a reserved status name`.

---

## Requirements Section Format

Specs may include a `## Requirements` section to record behavioural deltas. This section is optional — specs without it are valid, and `set status done` is a no-op for the delta merge step.

Each entry is a level-3 heading:

```
### ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED: <capability> / <requirement name>
```

- `<capability>` is a kebab-case slug (e.g. `bead-lifecycle`, `tui-tree-panel`) naming `specs/current/<capability>.md`.
- `<requirement name>` is free text, unique within the capability (case-insensitive).

**ADDED and MODIFIED entries** must contain:
- At least one sentence using `SHALL` or `MUST` (uppercase)
- At least one `#### Scenario: <name>` sub-heading, with `- **WHEN**` and `- **THEN**` lines

**REMOVED entries** must contain a `Reason:` line and must not contain scenarios.

Example:

```markdown
## Requirements

### ADDED: bead-lifecycle / Recovery bead on missing structured output
The scheduler SHALL create a `{bead_id}-recovery` bead when a worker
finishes without structured output.

#### Scenario: Developer bead returns prose only
- **WHEN** a developer bead's runner output contains no parseable JSON
- **THEN** a bead `<id>-recovery` with `agent_type=recovery` is created

### REMOVED: bead-lifecycle / Manual retry required after parse failure
Reason: superseded by automatic recovery beads.
```

Use `uv run takt spec validate <spec>` to check a spec's Requirements section before running the planner or transitioning to done.

## Writing a Spec

### Template

A default template is used when creating a new spec with `takt spec create`. The template includes only markdown sections but no frontmatter with metadata, as those will be managed automatically by the skill when initializing the skill.

The default template is `specs/spec-template.md`. You or the user can edit this file to change the default content for new specs depending on the project's needs. The template can include any content but the default version is a good starting point.

### Good spec practices

- Be prescriptive: agents implement exactly what the spec says. Vague specs produce vague implementations.
- Include concrete examples (function signatures, config YAML, CLI output) where helpful
- Reference existing code by file:line when the change is to a specific location
- Keep acceptance criteria verifiable — avoid "the code is clean" or "it works correctly"
- Resolved pending decisions should stay in the spec with their resolution, not be deleted

### What NOT to put in a spec

- Implementation details the agent should decide (e.g. variable names, internal algorithm choice)
- Speculative future features — scope to what's actually being built
- Duplicate content from project-level instructions
